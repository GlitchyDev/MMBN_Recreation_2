# MMBN_Recreation_2
MMBN_Recreation_2 is a more forward attempt to recreate the Gameboy Game Megaman Battle Network 1 in Java. With a better understanding of writing code, as well as a better 2d Library to use, the attempt should be able to get within decent accuracy of the original.

Goals:
- As much Graphical and Audio identicality as reasonably possible
- Adding Additional Content
- Recreate as much as the game as possible

NonConcerns:
- Project Size
- Forward Compatability
- Jar Creation ( For now )
- Controller Support ( Keyboard )
